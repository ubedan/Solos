Solos is a fork of Oxide Computer's Owned Cloud Computing solution, which is actually a rack of more than a dozen computers.

The goal of Solos-Cloud is to run Oxide's Cloud Computing Software stack on normal servers that you can buy.

Unfortunately SolOS loses some of the best features of Helios on Oxide Computer's hardware, as it doesn't have a secure root of trust for all of the hardware and software, and it doesn't support the customized hardware monitoring and control built into Oxide's solution.

SolOS will run on commodity hardware, and support Oxide's hardware independant cloud software management stack.
