Solos is a fork of Oxide Computer's Helios operating system that operates on standard hardware.

Unfortunately SolOS loses some of the best features of Helios on Oxide Computer's hardware, as it doesn't have a secure root of trust for all of the hardware and software, and it doesn't support the close hardware monitoring and control built into Oxide's solution.

SolOS will run on commodity hardware, and support Oxide's hardware independant cloud software management stack.
